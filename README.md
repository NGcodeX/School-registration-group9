# Introduction
Welcome to our Student Registration Portal project! This document serves as a guide to understanding the project's goals, features, and development methodology.
The University Student Registration Portal is an innovative web-based platform designed to simplify and streamline the process of university applications for prospective students. This portal aims to provide a user-friendly interface where students can easily register, fill out application forms, upload necessary documents, and track the status of their applications to specific university. For university administrators, the portal offers efficient tools to manage and review global applications, ensuring a smooth and organized admissions process in Cameroon.

# Agile Approach --> [Scrum Methodology](https://github.com/orgs/NGcodeX/projects/8/views/1)

Our team has adopted an Agile approach with Scrum methodology for this project. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, allowing us to respond to changes and deliver value to stakeholders continuously. Scrum is a framework within Agile that organizes work into short iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Here's how we're implementing Agile and Scrum in our project:

### Scrum Methodology:

1. **Sprints:** We organize our work into sprints, with each sprint focusing on delivering a set of features or improvements.
2. **Scrum Team:** Our team consists of a Scrum Master, responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, a Product Owner, representing the stakeholders and defining project requirements, and Development Team members, who collaborate to deliver the product.
3. **Daily Stand-ups:** We hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day, fostering communication and alignment within the team.
4. **Sprint Planning:** At the beginning of each sprint, we conduct sprint planning sessions to select the work to be completed and define the sprint goal.
5. **Sprint Review and Retrospective:** At the end of each sprint, we hold a review meeting to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback. We also conduct a retrospective to reflect on our process and identify areas for improvement.
