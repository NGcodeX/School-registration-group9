# Introduction
Welcome to our Student Registration Portal project! This document serves as a guide to understanding the project's goals, features, and development methodology.

# Project Overview
The Student Registration Portal is designed to streamline the student registration process for our university. Through this portal, students can register for courses, view their academic records, and manage their personal information.

# Agile Approach and Scrum Methodology
Our team has adopted an Agile approach with Scrum methodology for this project. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, allowing us to respond to changes and deliver value to stakeholders continuously. Scrum is a framework within Agile that organizes work into short iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Here's how we're implementing Agile and Scrum in our project:

### Agile Principles:
1. **Customer Satisfaction:** We prioritize delivering a working product that meets the needs of our users.
2. **Iterative Development:** We break down the project into smaller, manageable increments, allowing for continuous feedback and improvement.
3. **Collaboration:** Our team works closely with stakeholders, including university staff and students, to ensure the product aligns with their expectations.
4. **Adaptability:** We embrace change and are prepared to adjust our plans and priorities as needed throughout the project.

### Scrum Methodology:
1. **Sprints:** We organize our work into sprints, with each sprint focusing on delivering a set of features or improvements.
2. **Scrum Team:** Our team consists of a Scrum Master, responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, a Product Owner, representing the stakeholders and defining project requirements, and Development Team members, who collaborate to deliver the product.
3. **Daily Stand-ups:** We hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day, fostering communication and alignment within the team.
4. **Sprint Planning:** At the beginning of each sprint, we conduct sprint planning sessions to select the work to be completed and define the sprint goal.
5. **Sprint Review and Retrospective:** At the end of each sprint, we hold a review meeting to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback. We also conduct a retrospective to reflect on our process and identify areas for improvement.
